We show that the interior-point method, known to be effective for robust collision resolution, can be coupled with non-Newton procedures and be massively sped up on the GPU. Newton's method has been widely chosen for the interior-point family, which fully solves a linear system at each step. After that, the active set associated with collision/contact constraints is updated. Mimicking this routine using a non-Newton optimization (like gradient descent or ADMM) unfortunately does not deliver expected accelerations. This is because the barrier functions employed in an interior-point method need to be updated at every iteration to strictly confine the search to the feasible region. The associated cost (e.g., per-iteration CCD) quickly overweights the benefit brought by the GPU, and a new parallelism modality is needed. Our algorithm is inspired by the domain decomposition method and designed to move interior-point-related computations to local domains as much as possible. We minimize the size of each domain (i.e., a stencil) by restricting it to a single element, so as to fully exploit the capacity of modern GPUs. The stencil-level results are integrated into a global update using a novel hybrid sweep scheme. Our algorithm is locally second-order offering better convergence. It enables simulation acceleration of up to two orders over its CPU counterpart. We demonstrate the scalability, robustness, efficiency, and quality of our algorithm in a variety of simulation scenarios with complex and detailed collision geometries.}, journal = {ACM Trans.

abstract = {We propose an efficient cloth simulation method that combines the merits of two drastically different numerical procedures, namely the subspace integration and parallelizable iterative relaxation. We show those two methods can be organically coupled within the framework of projective dynamics (PD), where both low- and high-frequency cloth motions are effectively and efficiently computed. Our method works seamlessly with the state-of-the-art contact handling algorithm, the incremental potential contact (IPC), to offer the non-penetration guarantee of the resulting animation. Our core ingredient centers around the utilization of subspace for the expedited convergence of Jacobi-PD. This involves solving the reduced global system and smartly employing its precomputed factorization. In addition, we incorporate a time-splitting strategy to handle the frictional self-contacts. Specifically, during the PD solve, we employ a quadratic proxy to approximate the contact barrier. The prefactorized subspace system matrix is exploited in a reduced-space LBFGS. The LBFGS method starts with the reduced system matrix of the rest shape as the initial Hessian approximation, incorporating contact information into the reduced system progressively, while the full-space Jacobi iteration captures high-frequency details. Furthermore, we address penetration issues through a penetration correction step. It minimizes an incremental potential without elasticity using Newton-PCG. Our method can be efficiently executed on modern GPUs. Experiments show significant performance improvements over existing GPU solvers for high-resolution cloth simulation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to couple Finite Element Methods (FEM), typically employed for modeling Lagrangian solids such as flesh, cloth, hair, and rigid bodies, with Material Point Methods (MPM), which are well-suited for simulating materials undergoing substantial deformation and topology change, including Newtonian/non-Newtonian fluid, granular materials, and fracturing materials. The challenge of coupling these diverse methods arises from their contrasting computational needs: implicit FEM integration is often favored to enjoy stability and large timesteps, while explicit MPM integration benefits from its allowance for efficient GPU optimization and flexibility of applying different plasticity models, which only allows for moderate timesteps. To bridge this gap, a mixed implicit-explicit time integration (IMEX) approach is proposed, utilizing principles from time splitting for partial differential equations and optimization-based time integrators. This method adopts incremental potential contact (IPC) to define a variational frictional contact model between the two materials, serving as the primary coupling mechanism. Our method enables implicit FEM and explicit MPM to coexist with significantly different timestep sizes while preserving two-way coupling. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our method as a strong foundation for future exploration and enhancement in the field of multi-material simulation.},

abstract = {We extend the incremental potential contact (IPC) model [Li et al. 2020a] for contacting elastodynamics to resolve systems composed of codimensional degrees-of-freedoms in arbitrary combination. This enables a unified, interpenetration-free, robust, and stable simulation framework that couples codimension-0,1,2, and 3 geometries seamlessly with frictional contact. Extending the IPC model to thin structures poses new challenges in computing strain, modeling thickness and determining collisions. To address these challenges we propose three corresponding contributions. First, we introduce a C2 constitutive barrier model that directly enforces strain limiting as an energy potential while preserving rest state. This provides energetically-consistent strain limiting models (both isotropic and anisotropic) for cloth that enable strict satisfaction of strain-limit inequalities with direct coupling to both elastodynamics and contact via minimization of the incremental potential. Second, to capture the geometric thickness of codimensional domains we extend the IPC model to directly enforce distance offsets. Our treatment imposes a strict guarantee that mid-surfaces (respectively mid-lines) of shells (respectively rods) will not move closer than applied thickness values, even as these thicknesses become characteristically small. This enables us to account for thickness in the contact behavior of codimensional structures and so robustly capture challenging contacting geometries; a number of which, to our knowledge, have not been simulated before. Third, codimensional models, especially with modeled thickness, mandate strict accuracy requirements that pose a severe challenge to all existing continuous collision detection (CCD) methods. To address these limitations we develop a new, efficient, simple-to-implement additive CCD (ACCD) method that applies conservative advancement [Mirtich 1996; Zhang et al. 2006] to iteratively refine a lower bound for deforming primitives, converging to time of impact. In combination these contributions enable codimensional IPC (C-IPC). We perform extensive benchmark experiments to validate the efficacy of our method in capturing intricate behaviors of thin-structure contact and resulting bulk effects. In our experiments C-IPC obtains feasible, convergent, and so artifact-free solutions for all time steps, across all tested examples - producing robust simulations. We test C-IPC across extreme deformations, large time steps, and exceedingly close contact over all possible pairings of codimensional domains. Finally, with our strain-limit model, we confirm C-IPC guarantees non-intersection and strain-limit satisfaction for all reasonable (and well below - verified down to 0.1\%) strain limits throughout all time steps.},

We name this new framework Medial IPC as it integrates the merits from medial elastics, for an efficient and versatile reduced simulation, as well as incremental potential contact, for a robust collision and contact resolution. We leverage medial axis transform to construct a kinematic subspace. Instead of resorting to projective dynamics, we use classic hyperelastics to embrace real-world nonlinear materials. A novel reduced continuous collision detection algorithm is presented based on the medial mesh. Thanks to unique geometric properties of medial axis and medial primitives, we derive closed-form formulations for identifying between-primitive collision within the reduced medial space. In the meantime, the implicit barrier energy that generates necessary repulsion forces for collision resolution is also formulated with the medial coordinate. In other words, Medial IPC exploits a universal reduced coordinate for simulation, continuous self-/collision detection, and IPC-based collision resolution. Continuous collision detection also allows more aggressive time stepping. In addition, we carefully implement our system with a heterogeneous CPU-GPU deployment such that massively parallelizable computations are carried out on the GPU while few sequential computations are on the CPU. Such implementation also frees us from generating training poses for selecting Cubature points and pre-computing their weights. We have tested our method on complicated deformable models and collision-rich simulation scenarios. Due to the reduced nature of our system, the computation is faster than fullspace IPC or other fullspace methods using continuous collision detection by at least one order. The simulation remains high-quality as the medial subspace captures intriguing and local deformations with sufficient realism.},

abstract = {The linear conjugate gradient method is widely used in physical simulation, particularly for solving large-scale linear systems derived from Newton’s method. The nonlinear conjugate gradient method generalizes the conjugate gradient method to nonlinear optimization, which is extensively utilized in solving practical large-scale unconstrained optimization problems. However, it is rarely discussed in physical simulation due to the requirement of multiple vector-vector dot products. Fortunately, with the advancement of GPU-parallel acceleration techniques, it is no longer a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a Jacobi preconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient method for elastic deformation using interior-point methods. Our method is straightforward, GPU-parallelizable, and exhibits fast convergence and robustness against large time steps. The employment of the barrier function in interior-point methods necessitates continuous collision detection per iteration to obtain a penetration-free step size, which is computationally expensive and challenging to parallelize on GPUs. To address this issue, we introduce a line search strategy that deduces an appropriate step size in a single pass, eliminating the need for additional collision detection. Furthermore, we simplify and accelerate the computations of Jacobi preconditioning and Hessian-vector product for hyperelasticity and barrier function. Our method can accurately simulate objects comprising over 100,000 tetrahedra in complex self-collision scenarios at real-time speeds.},

We present an approach to rewriting the barrier function for arriving at an efficient and robust approximation of its Hessian. The key idea is to formulate a simplicial geometric measure of contact using mesh boundary elements, from which analytic eigensystems are derived and enhanced with filtering and stiffening terms that ensure robustness with respect to the convergence of a Project-Newton solver. A further advantage of our rewriting of the barrier function is that it naturally caters to the notorious case of nearly parallel edge-edge contacts for which we also present a novel analytic eigensystem. Our approach is thus well suited for standard second-order unconstrained optimization strategies for resolving contacts, minimizing nonlinear nonconvex functions where the Hessian may be indefinite. The efficiency of our eigensystems alone yields a 3\texttimes{} speedup over the standard Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) barrier formulation. We further apply our analytic proxy eigensystems to produce an entirely GPU-based implementation of IPC with significant further acceleration.},

abstract = {We present a GPU algorithm for deformable simulation. Our method offers good computational efficiency and penetration-free guarantee at the same time, which are not common with existing techniques. The main idea is an algorithmic integration of projective dynamics (PD) and incremental potential contact (IPC). PD is a position-based simulation framework, favored for its robust convergence and convenient implementation. We show that PD can be employed to handle the variational optimization with the interior point method e.g., IPC. While conceptually straightforward, this requires a dedicated rework over the collision resolution and the iteration modality to avoid incorrect collision projection with improved numerical convergence. IPC exploits a barrier-based formulation, which yields an infinitely large penalty when the constraint is on the verge of being violated. This mechanism guarantees intersection-free trajectories of deformable bodies during the simulation, as long as they are apart at the rest configuration. On the downside, IPC brings a large amount of nonlinearity to the system, making PD slower to converge. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel GPU algorithm named A-Jacobi for faster linear solve at the global step of PD. A-Jacobi is based on Jacobi iteration, but it better harvests the computation capacity on modern GPUs by lumping several Jacobi steps into a single iteration. In addition, we also re-design the CCD root finding procedure by using a new minimum-gradient Newton algorithm. Those saved time budgets allow more iterations to accommodate stiff IPC barriers so that the result is both realistic and collision-free. Putting together, our algorithm simulates complicated models of both solids and shells on the GPU at an interactive rate or even in real time.},

Rigid body modeling has thus long remained a critical tool and is, by far, the most popular simulation strategy currently employed for modeling stiff solids. At the same time, rigid body methods continue to pose a number of well known challenges and trade-offs including intersections, instabilities, inaccuracies, and/or slow performances that grow with contact-problem complexity. In this paper we revisit the stiff body problem and present ABD, a simple and highly effective affine body dynamics framework, which significantly improves state-of-the-art for simulating stiff-body dynamics. We trace the challenges in rigid-body methods to the necessity of linearizing piecewise-rigid trajectories and subsequent constraints. ABD instead relaxes the unnecessary (and unrealistic) constraint that each body's motion be exactly rigid with a stiff orthogonality potential, while preserving the rigid body model's key feature of a small coordinate representation. In doing so ABD replaces piecewise linearization with piecewise linear trajectories. This, in turn, combines the best of both worlds: compact coordinates ensure small, sparse system solves, while piecewise-linear trajectories enable efficient and accurate constraint (contact and joint) evaluations. Beginning with this simple foundation, ABD preserves all guarantees of the underlying IPC model we build it upon, e.g., solution convergence, guaranteed non-intersection, and accurate frictional contact. Over a wide range and scale of simulation problems we demonstrate that ABD brings orders of magnitude performance gains (two- to three-orders on the CPU and an order more when utilizing the GPU, obtaining 10, 000\texttimes{} speedups) over prior IPC-based methods, while maintaining simulation quality and nonintersection of trajectories. At the same time ABD has comparable or faster timings when compared to state-of-the-art rigid body libraries optimized for performance without guarantees, and successfully and efficiently solves challenging simulation problems where both classes of prior rigid body simulation methods fail altogether.}, journal = {ACM Trans.

Our method builds on the TetWild algorithm, replacing the rational triangle insertion with a new incremental approach to construct and optimize the output mesh, interleaving triangle insertion and mesh optimization. Our approach makes it possible to maintain a valid floating-point tetrahedral mesh at all algorithmic stages, eliminating the need for costly constructions with rational numbers used by TetWild, while maintaining full robustness and similar output quality. This allows us to improve on TetWild in two ways. First, our algorithm is significantly faster, with running time comparable to less robust Delaunay-based tetrahedralization algorithms. Second, our algorithm is guaranteed to produce a valid tetrahedral mesh with floating-point vertex coordinates, while TetWild produces a valid mesh with rational coordinates which is not guaranteed to be valid after floating-point conversion. As a trade-off, our algorithm no longer guarantees that all input triangles are present in the output mesh, but in practice, as confirmed by our tests on the Thingi10k dataset, the algorithm always succeeds in inserting all input triangles.},

  abstract   = {We present a robust method for generating high-order nodal tetrahedral curved meshes. The approach consists of modifying an initial linear mesh by ﬁrst, introducing high-order nodes, second, displacing the boundary nodes to ensure that they are on the computer-aided design surface, and third, smoothing and untangling the mesh obtained after the displacement of the boundary nodes to produce a valid curved highorder mesh. The smoothing algorithm is based on the optimization of a regularized measure of the mesh distortion relative to the original linear mesh. This means that whenever possible, the resulting mesh preserves the geometrical features of the initial linear mesh such as shape, stretching, and size. We present several examples to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the examples show that the implementation of the optimization problem is robust and capable of handling situations in which the mesh before optimization contains a large number of invalid elements. We consider cases with polynomial approximations up to degree ten, large deformations of the curved boundaries, concave boundaries, and highly stretched boundary layer elements. The meshes obtained are suitable for high-order ﬁnite element analyses. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The approach is based on several core principles: (1) initial mesh construction based on a fully robust, yet efficient, filtered exact computation (2) explicit (automatic or user-defined) tolerancing of the mesh relative to the surface input (3) iterative mesh improvement with guarantees, at every step, of the output validity. The quality of the resulting mesh is a direct function of the target mesh size and allowed tolerance: increasing allowed deviation from the initial mesh and decreasing the target edge length both lead to higher mesh quality.

  abstract = {Solid shapes in computer graphics are often represented with boundary descriptions, e.g. triangle meshes, but animation, physicallybased simulation, and geometry processing are more realistic and accurate when explicit volume representations are available. Tetrahedral meshes which exactly contain (interpolate) the input boundary description are desirable but difﬁcult to construct for a large class of input meshes. Character meshes and CAD models are often composed of many connected components with numerous selfintersections, non-manifold pieces, and open boundaries, precluding existing meshing algorithms. We propose an automatic algorithm handling all of these issues, resulting in a compact discretization of the input’s inner volume. We only require reasonably consistent orientation of the input triangle mesh. By generalizing the winding number for arbitrary triangle meshes, we deﬁne a function that is a perfect segmentation for watertight input and is well-behaved otherwise. This function guides a graphcut segmentation of a constrained Delaunay tessellation (CDT), providing a minimal description that meets the boundary exactly and may be fed as input to existing tools to achieve element quality. We highlight our robustness on a number of examples and show applications of solving PDEs, volumetric texturing and elastic simulation.},

The mesh is guaranteed to conform exactly, without geometric error, to arbitrary rational domain boundary and feature curves. The method generalizes the recent Bézier Guarding technique, which is applicable only to polynomial curves and elements. This generalization enables the accurate handling of practically important cases involving, for instance, circular or elliptic arcs and NURBS curves, which cannot be matched by polynomial elements. Furthermore, although many practical scenarios are concerned with rational functions of quadratic and cubic degree only, our method is fully general and supports arbitrary degree. We demonstrate the method on a variety of test cases.},

The resulting mesh consists of regular, injective higher-order triangular elements and precisely conforms with the domain's curved boundary. No smoothness requirements are imposed on the boundary. Prescribed piecewise polynomial curves in the interior, like material interfaces or feature curves, can be taken into account for precise interpolation by the resulting mesh's edges as well. In its core, the algorithm is based on a novel explicit construction of guaranteed injective Bézier triangles with certain edge curves and edge parametrizations prescribed. Due to the use of only rational arithmetic, the algorithm can optionally be performed using exact number types in practice, so as to provide robustness guarantees.},

The resulting mesh consists of higher-order triangular elements which are not only regular (i.e., with injective geometric map) but respect strict bounds on quality measures like scaled Jacobian and MIPS distortion. This also implies that the curved triangles' inner angles are bounded from above and below. These are key quality criteria, for instance, in the field of finite element analysis. The domain boundary is reproduced exactly, without geometric approximation error. The central idea is to transform the curvilinear meshing problem into a linear meshing problem via a carefully constructed transformation of bounded distortion, enabling us to leverage key results on guaranteed-quality straight-edge triangulation. The transformation is based on a simple yet general construction and observations about convergence properties of curves under subdivision. Our algorithm can handle arbitrary polynomial order, arbitrarily sharp corners, feature and interface curves, and can be executed using rational arithmetic for strict reliability.},

It describes the key software components of TetGen, including an efficient tetrahedral mesh data structure, a set of enhanced local mesh operations (combination of flips and edge removal), and filtered exact geometric predicates. The essential algorithms include incremental Delaunay algorithms for inserting vertices, constrained Delaunay algorithms for inserting constraints (edges and triangles), a new edge recovery algorithm for recovering constraints, and a new constrained Delaunay refinement algorithm for adaptive quality tetrahedral mesh generation. Experimental examples as well as comparisons with other softwares are presented.},

We aim to provide a route to investigate this question, by examining popular high-order mesh generation methods in the context of an eﬃcient variational framework for the generation of curvilinear meshes. By considering previous works in a variational form, we are able to compare their characteristics and study their robustness. Alongside a description of the theory and practical implementation details, including an eﬃcient multi-threading parallelisation strategy, we demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the framework, showing how it can be used for both mesh quality optimisation and untangling of invalid meshes.},

We use the benchmark to evaluate the accuracy, correctness, and efficiency of state-of-the-art continuous collision detection algorithms, both with and without minimal separation.We discover that, despite the widespread use of CCD algorithms, existing algorithms are (1) correct but impractically slow; (2) efficient but incorrect, introducing false negatives that will lead to interpenetration; or (3) correct but over conservative, reporting a large number of false positives that might lead to inaccuracies when integrated in a simulator.By combining the seminal interval root finding algorithm introduced by Snyder in 1992 with modern predicate design techniques, we propose a simple and efficient CCD algorithm. This algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of runtime while conservatively reporting the time of impact and allowing explicit tradeoff between runtime efficiency and number of false positives reported.},

abstract = {Continuous collision detection (CCD) between deforming triangle mesh elements in 3D is a critical tool for many applications. The standard method involving a cubic polynomial solver is vulnerable to rounding error, requiring the use of ad hoc tolerances, and nevertheless is particularly fragile in (near-)planar cases. Even with per-simulation tuning, it may still cause problems by missing collisions or erroneously flagging non-collisions. We present a geometrically exact alternative guaranteed to produce the correct Boolean result (significant collision or not) as if calculated with exact arithmetic, even in degenerate scenarios. Our critical insight is that only the parity of the number of collisions is needed for robust simulation, and this parity can be calculated with simpler non-constructive predicates. In essence we analyze the roots of the nonlinear system of equations defining CCD through careful consideration of the boundary of the parameter domain. The use of new conservative culling and interval filters allows typical simulations to run as fast as with the non-robust version, but without need for tuning or worries about failure cases even in geometrically degenerate scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of geometrically exact detection with a novel adaptive cloth simulation, the first to guarantee to remain intersection-free despite frequent curvature-driven remeshing.},

This breadth is largely due to the expansive list of geometric primitives, e.g., splines, triangles, and hexahedra, joined with an ever-expanding variety of objectives one might want to achieve with them. With the recent increase in attention toward higher-order surfaces, we can expect a variety of challenges porting existing solutions that work on triangle meshes to work on these more complex geometry types. In this paper, we present a framework for solving many core geometry processing problems on higher-order surfaces. We achieve this goal through sum-of-squares optimization, which transforms nonlinear polynomial optimization problems into sequences of convex problems whose complexity is captured by a single degree parameter. This allows us to solve a suite of problems on higher-order surfaces, such as continuous collision detection and closest point queries on curved patches, with only minor changes between formulations and geometries.},

We use these improvements to speed up difficult problems like collision detection between B\'{e}zier triangles by as much as 300 \texttimes{}. In addition, motivated by hair bundle simulation, we present SOSP based collision detection on the tapered cubic cylinder. We also present an algebraic formulation of rigid body motion enabling SOSP based collision detection for curved geometries and trajectories simultaneously. While these new formulations are complex, our speedups make them feasible. These advances improve the applicability of SOSP based collision detection and enable the continued progress of higher-order geometry processing.},

publisher = {ACM},
address = {New York, NY, USA},
abstract = {Range functions are an important tool for interval computations, and they can be employed for the problem of root isolation. In this paper, we first introduce two new classes of range functions for real functions. They are based on the remainder form by Cornelius and Lohner [7] and provide different improvements for the remainder part of this form. On the one hand, we use centered Taylor expansions to derive a generalization of the classical Taylor form with higher than quadratic convergence. On the other hand, we propose a recursive interpolation procedure, in particular based on quadratic Lagrange interpolation, leading to recursive Lagrange forms with cubic and quartic convergence. We then use these forms for isolating the real roots of square-free polynomials with the algorithm Eval, a relatively recent algorithm that has been shown to be effective and practical. Finally, we compare the performance of our new range functions against the standard Taylor form. Range functions are often compared in isolation; in contrast, our holistic comparison is based on their performance in an application. Specifically, Eval can exploit features of our recursive Lagrange forms which are not found in range functions based on Taylor expansion. Experimentally, this yields at least a twofold speedup in Eval.},

abstract = {We address the fundamental problem of computing range functions
[inline-graphic not available: see fulltext]
for a real function f:R→R. In our previous work [9], we introduced recursive interpolation range functions based on the Cornelius–Lohner (CL) framework of decomposing f as f=g+R, which requires to compute g(I) “exactly” for an interval I. There are two problems: this approach limits the order of convergence to 6 in practice, and exact computation is impossible to achieve in standard implementation models. We generalize the CL framework by allowing g(I) to be approximated by strong range functions[inline-graphic not available: see fulltext]
, where ε>0 is a user-specified bound on the error. This new framework allows, for the first time, the design of interval forms for f with any desired order of convergence. To achieve our strong range functions, we generalize Neumaier’s theory of constructing range functions from expressions over a Lipschitz class Ω of primitive functions. We show that the class Ω is very extensive and includes all common hypergeometric functions. Traditional complexity analysis of range functions is based on individual evaluation on an interval. Such analysis cannot differentiate between our novel recursive range functions and classical Taylor-type range functions. Empirically, our recursive functions are superior in the “holistic” context of the root isolation algorithm Eval. We now formalize this holistic approach by defining the amortized complexity of range functions over a subdivision tree. Our theoretical model agrees remarkably well with the empirical results. Among our previous novel range functions, we identified a Lagrange-type range function
[inline-graphic not available: see fulltext]
as the overall winner. In this paper, we introduce a Hermite-type range function
[inline-graphic not available: see fulltext]
that is even better. We further explore speeding up applications by choosing non-maximal recursion levels.},

	abstract = {Numerical errors and rounding errors in continuous collision detection (CCD) can easily cause collision detection failures if they are not handled properly. A simple and eﬀective approach is to use error tolerances, as shown in many existing CCD systems. Unfortunately, ﬁnding the optimal tolerance values is a diﬃcult problem for users. Larger tolerance values will introduce false positive artifacts, while smaller tolerance values may cause collisions to be undetected. The biggest issue here is that we do not know whether or when CCD will fail, even though failures are extremely rare. In this paper, we demonstrate a set of simple modiﬁcations to make a basic CCD implementation failure-proof. Using error analysis, we prove the safety of this method and we formulate suggested tolerance values to reduce false positives. The resulting algorithms are safe, automatic, eﬃcient, and easy to implement.},

abstract = {We present an efficient and robust algorithm for finding points of collision between time-dependent parametric and implicit surfaces. The algorithm detects simultaneous collisions at multiple points of contact. When the regions of contact form curves or surfaces, it returns a finite set of points uniformly distributed over each contact region. Collisions can be computed for a very general class of surfaces: those for which inclusion functions can be constructed. Included in this set are the familiar kinds of surfaces and time behaviors encountered in computer graphics. We use a new interval approach for constrained minimization to detect collisions, and a tangency condition to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. These approaches make interval methods practical for multi-point collisions between complex surfaces. An interval Newton method based on the solution of the interval linear equation is used to speed convergence to the collision time and location. This method is more efficient than the Krawczyk–Moore iteration used previously in computer graphics.},

abstract = {Mainstream math libraries for floating point (FP) do not produce correctly rounded results for all inputs. In contrast, CR-LIBM and RLIBM provide correctly rounded implementations for a specific FP representation with one rounding mode. Using such libraries for a representation with a new rounding mode or with different precision will result in wrong results due to double rounding. This paper proposes a novel method to generate a single polynomial approximation that produces correctly rounded results for all inputs for multiple rounding modes and multiple precision configurations. To generate a correctly rounded library for n-bits, our key idea is to generate a polynomial approximation for a representation with n+2-bits using the round-to-odd mode. We prove that the resulting polynomial approximation will produce correctly rounded results for all five rounding modes in the standard and for multiple representations with k-bits such that |E| +1 < k ≤ n, where |E| is the number of exponent bits in the representation. Similar to our prior work in the RLIBM project, we approximate the correctly rounded result when we generate the library with n+2-bits using the round-to-odd mode. We also generate polynomial approximations by structuring it as a linear programming problem but propose enhancements to polynomial generation to handle the round-to-odd mode. Our prototype is the first 32-bit float library that produces correctly rounded results with all rounding modes in the IEEE standard for all inputs with a single polynomial approximation. It also produces correctly rounded results for any FP configuration ranging from 10-bits to 32-bits while also being faster than mainstream libraries.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for generating a single polynomial approximation that produces correctly rounded results for all inputs of an elementary function for multiple representations. The generated polynomial approximation has the nice property that the first few lower degree terms produce correctly rounded results for specific representations of smaller bitwidths, which we call progressive performance. To generate such progressive polynomial approximations, we approximate the correctly rounded result and formulate the computation of correctly rounded polynomial approximations as a linear program similar to our prior work on the RLIBM project. To enable the use of resulting polynomial approximations in mainstream libraries, we want to avoid piecewise polynomials with large lookup tables. We observe that the problem of computing polynomial approximations for elementary functions is a linear programming problem in low dimensions, i.e., with a small number of unknowns. We design a fast randomized algorithm for computing polynomial approximations with progressive performance. Our method produces correct and fast polynomials that require a small amount of storage. A few polynomial approximations from our prototype have already been incorporated into LLVM’s math library.},

abstract = {We extend the incremental potential contact (IPC) model [Li et al. 2020a] for contacting elastodynamics to resolve systems composed of codimensional degrees-of-freedoms in arbitrary combination. This enables a unified, interpenetration-free, robust, and stable simulation framework that couples codimension-0,1,2, and 3 geometries seamlessly with frictional contact. Extending the IPC model to thin structures poses new challenges in computing strain, modeling thickness and determining collisions. To address these challenges we propose three corresponding contributions. First, we introduce a C2 constitutive barrier model that directly enforces strain limiting as an energy potential while preserving rest state. This provides energetically-consistent strain limiting models (both isotropic and anisotropic) for cloth that enable strict satisfaction of strain-limit inequalities with direct coupling to both elastodynamics and contact via minimization of the incremental potential. Second, to capture the geometric thickness of codimensional domains we extend the IPC model to directly enforce distance offsets. Our treatment imposes a strict guarantee that mid-surfaces (respectively mid-lines) of shells (respectively rods) will not move closer than applied thickness values, even as these thicknesses become characteristically small. This enables us to account for thickness in the contact behavior of codimensional structures and so robustly capture challenging contacting geometries; a number of which, to our knowledge, have not been simulated before. Third, codimensional models, especially with modeled thickness, mandate strict accuracy requirements that pose a severe challenge to all existing continuous collision detection (CCD) methods. To address these limitations we develop a new, efficient, simple-to-implement additive CCD (ACCD) method that applies conservative advancement [Mirtich 1996; Zhang et al. 2006] to iteratively refine a lower bound for deforming primitives, converging to time of impact. In combination these contributions enable codimensional IPC (C-IPC). We perform extensive benchmark experiments to validate the efficacy of our method in capturing intricate behaviors of thin-structure contact and resulting bulk effects. In our experiments C-IPC obtains feasible, convergent, and so artifact-free solutions for all time steps, across all tested examples - producing robust simulations. We test C-IPC across extreme deformations, large time steps, and exceedingly close contact over all possible pairings of codimensional domains. Finally, with our strain-limit model, we confirm C-IPC guarantees non-intersection and strain-limit satisfaction for all reasonable (and well below - verified down to 0.1\%) strain limits throughout all time steps.},

The algorithm expands upon a recent breakthrough that only calculates the one-sided Hausdorff distance from the triangle mesh to the quad mesh using what is called “matching” and “upper bounding” of candidate pieces. We complete the algorithm by accomplishing the computation of the one-sided Hausdorff distance in the opposite direction: from the quad mesh to the triangle mesh. We split each quad into two triangular pieces to simplify the breakdown of matching cases and provide additional matching methods for new cases. By fusing the two one-sided computation algorithms, one can compute the two-sided Hausdorff distance that, for instance, can properly evaluate a quad mesh approximation of a triangle mesh. Experimental results show that our algorithm can handle near-zero Hausdorff distance, which has always been known to be a much difficult task, in an interactive time. Moreover, the improvement in efficiency of the two-sided Hausdorff distance computation over the successive execution of the two one-sided computations is addressed.}

No explicit reconstruction of the medial axis is conducted and only bisectors of pairs of primitives (i.e. vertex, edge, or face) are analytically constructed and intersected with the other mesh, yielding a set of conic segments. For each conic segment, the distance functions to all primitives are constructed and the maximum value of their low envelope function may correspond to a candidate point for the Hausdorff distance. The algorithm is fully implemented and several experimental results are also presented.}

keywords = {computational geometry, modeling},
abstract = {Abstract The Hausdorff distance is one of the most fundamental metrics for comparing 3D shapes. To compute the Hausdorff distance efficiently from a triangular mesh to another triangular mesh , one needs to cull the unnecessary triangles on quickly. These triangles have no chance to improve the Hausdorff distance estimation, that is the parts with local upper bound smaller than the global lower bound. The local upper bound estimation should be tight, use fast distance computation, and involve a small number of triangles in during the reduction phase for efficiency. In this paper, we propose to use point-triangle distance, and only involve at most four triangles in in the reduction phase. Comparing with the state-of-the-art proposed by Tang et al. in 2009, which uses more costly triangle-triangle distance and may involve a large number of triangles in reduction phase, our local upper bound estimation is faster, and with only a small impact on the tightness of the bound on error estimation. Such a more economic strategy boosts the overall performance significantly. Experiments on the Thingi10K dataset show that our method can achieve several (even over 20) times speedup on average. On a few models with different placements and resolutions, we show that close placement and large difference in resolution bring big challenges to Hausdorff distance computation, and explain why our method can achieve more significant speedup on challenging cases.},

The algorithm is based on a hybrid Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH), where osculating toroidal patches (stored in the leaf nodes) provide geometric properties essential for the HD computation in high precision. Intrinsic features from the osculating geometry resolve computational issues in handling the cross-boundary problem for composite surfaces, which leads to the acceleration of HD algorithm with a solution (within machine precision) to the exact HD. The HD computation for general freeform surfaces is discussed, where we focus on the computational issues in handling the local geometry across surface boundaries or around surface corners that appear as the result of gluing multiple patches together in the modeling of generic composite surfaces. We also discuss how to switch from an approximation stage to the final step of computing the precise HD using numerical improvements and confirming the correctness of the HD computation result. The main advantage of our algorithm is in the high precision of HD computation result. As the best cases of the proposed torus-based approach, we also consider the acceleration of HD computation for freeform surfaces of revolution and linear extrusion, where we can support real-time computation even for deformable surfaces. The acceleration is mainly due to a fast biarc approximation to the planar profile curves of the simple surfaces, each generated by rotating or translating a planar curve. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using experimental results.}

abstract = {We present an interactive-speed algorithm for computing the Hausdorff Distance (HD) between two freeform geometric models represented with NURBS surfaces. The algorithm is based on an effective technique for matching a surface patch from one model to the corresponding nearby surface patch on the other model. To facilitate the matching procedure, we employ a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) for freeform NURBS surfaces, which provides a hierarchy of Coons patches and bilinear surfaces approximating the NURBS surfaces (Kim et al., 2011 [1]). Comparing the local HD upper bound against a global HD lower bound, we can eliminate the majority of redundant surface patches from further consideration. The resulting algorithm and the associated data structures are considerably simpler than the previous BVH-based HD algorithms. As a result, we can compute the HD of two freeform geometric models efficiently and robustly even when the two models are in close proximity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using several experimental results.}
